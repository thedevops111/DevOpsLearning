## What is DevOps?
DevOps combines software development and IT operations to enable continuous delivery and high-quality releases in shorter timeframes.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you are familiar with:

Git: For version control.
GitHub: For hosting repositories.
Command Line Basics: For running scripts and commands.
Step-by-Step: Creating a GitHub Repository
### 1. Sign Up for GitHub
Go to GitHub and create an account.
After registering, you can create a new repository.
### 2. Create a New Repository
To create your first repository:

Click on the New button in the top right.
Name your repository (e.g., my-devops-journey).
Add a short description (optional).
Choose the visibility (Public or Private).
Check the box to initialize with a README.md file.
Click Create repository.
### 3. Clone Your Repository
Once the repository is created:

Open your terminal.
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-devops-journey.git
Navigate into your project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd my-devops-journey
### 4. Commit and Push Changes
To update the repository with your code:

Stage your changes:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Creating a CI Workflow
Use GitHub Actions for automating the CI pipeline. Hereâ€™s a basic guide:

1. Add a Workflow
In your repository, click on the Actions tab.
Choose Set up a workflow yourself.
2. Define the Workflow
Add the following code to .github/workflows/ci.yml:

yaml
Copy code
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
3. Monitor Workflow
Go to the Actions tab to view the status of your CI pipeline.
A green checkmark indicates success, while a red cross shows a failure.
Next Steps
Explore Continuous Deployment (CD): Automate your deployment process.
Learn Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use tools like Terraform or Ansible to manage infrastructure.
Containerization: Start using Docker and Kubernetes.
Markdown Tips for GitHub
Use # for large headings (H1), ## for subheadings (H2), and so on. Example:

markdown
Copy code
# H1 - Main Heading
## H2 - Subheading
### H3 - Smaller Subheading
To create a list:

markdown
Copy code
- Item 1
- Item 2
To include code snippets, use backticks:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-devops-journey.git
